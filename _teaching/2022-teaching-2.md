Lead 1st year undergraduates in their experiments regarding simple harmonic motion, Newton's law of cooling and using Fourier transforms to investigate spectra of tuning forks and to measure the radius and mass of stars using helioseismology. Also began developing the later helioseismology experiment to include the full dataset of the satellite to improve frequency resolution.
