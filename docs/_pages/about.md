My supervisors are [Prof. Richard Dendy](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/cfsa/people/dendy/) & [Prof. Sandra Chapman](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/cfsa/people/sandrac/).

I am a second year Ph.D. student (2021-2025) at the University of Warwick in the [CFSA](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/cfsa/people/slade-harajda/) department. My project utilises the particle-in-cell (PIC) code [EPOCH](https://epochpic.github.io) to simulate two and three ion species fusion plasmas where one species is an energetic minority distributed as a [ring-beam](https://tobiassh0.github.io/files/Doublet-splitting-Cook2022.pdf). This leads to an instability known as the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI) which is the resonation of the energetic minority with the fast Alfv√©n wave (FAW) leading to the driving of ion cyclotron emission (ICE).

My work thus far has focussed on the inclusion of a tertiary ion (tritium) in the $D$-$T\rightarrow\alpha$ reaction where previous investigations have ignored it. The consequences of this inclusion on power spectra, resonace conditions and energey transfer are a primary interest of mine, but future work will investigate the aneutronic $D$-$He_3\rightarrow p$ reaction for potential future ITER experiments.
