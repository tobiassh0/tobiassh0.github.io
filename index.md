My name is Tobias Slade-Harajda and I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student studying at the University of Warwick looking at simulated fusion plasmas and primarily measuring the effect of the tertiary ion concentration on the measured ion cyclotron emission (ICE) in D-T and aneutronic D-He3 plasmas.

ICE is a suprathermal emission brought on by instabilities within a fusion plasma. In its linear instability phase, the excitation mechanism for ICE is the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI). As ICE is a passive diagnostic tool for fast ion physics, it is highly advantageous to apply knowledge gained from observing ICE to magnetically confined fusion (MCF) plasmas with the aim to improve tokamak efficiency and maintain the thermonuclear burn.

This project utilises HPC simulations to describe a minority energetic population of energetic (3.5MeV) alpha particles, and obtain typical ICE spectra observed in experiment. Further work will look at simulating aneutronic fusion reactions to mitigate the ionisation of the tokamak inner wall, hence increasing the efficiency of tokamaks and their longevity.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
