	- **Abstract** : In the second issue of the Journal of PGR Pedagogic Practice, published for the academic year 2022-23, our PGR authors reflect on their experiences of teaching throughout the pandemic, and the lessons we can learn as we move into the post-pandemic world. Many of the articles in this issue address the challenges GTAs have been confronted with in their teaching and as a part of their wider identity as postgraduate researchers. Our authors address issues of engagement through online teaching, and the innovative methods they have adopted to facilitate learning. Others engage in the important work of decolonising the classroom, explore GTA identity and wellbeing, and draw on lessons from beyond the undergraduate classroom. Since the premier issue, interest in the JPPP has grown beyond our own institution, and we hope that future issues will continue to provide fresh perspectives on the wider experiences, interactions, and practices of PGR teachers within Higher Education.
