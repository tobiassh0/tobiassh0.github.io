## Talks & posters


Talks
======
- **Departmental talk 29/04/2024** ([here](./assets/data/shared-area.pdf))
	- Presentated my development of the [shared area method](./assets/data/CFSA-Seminar-190623.pdf). Discussed theory, use cases, and examples of real data including ICE power spectra, helioseismology & financial data.
- **ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 07/03/2024**
	- ARCHER2 (HPC) celebration of science event in Edinburgh. Short summary presentation on DT three ion work with a more detailed poster session to a range of STEM disciplines
- **FuseNet Ph.D. pechakucha talk 23/08/2023** ([here](./assets/data/PechaKucha2023.pdf))
	- Talk to the wider Ph.D. FuseNet community for their [2023 Ph.D. event](https://indico.fusenet.eu/event/47/) at the EPFL Swiss plasma centre in a PechaKucha style talk and through the delivery of a poster (see EPS 2023 poster). Summarised my project, the results and some future work.
- **Departmental talk 19/06/2023** ([here](./assets/data/CFSA-Seminar-190623.pdf))
	- Follow up talk to the CFSA department detailing my project progress and some prelimiary results from including a third ion in the PIC code EPOCH on [JET pulse 26148](./assets/data/ICE_Cottrell_1993_Nucl_Fusion_33_1365.pdf).
- **Postgraduate talk 29/09/2022** ([here](./assets/data/PG-Seminar-290922.mp4))
	- Talk delivered to the Physics Postgrad community, covering the basis of my project and some early results with three ions including the issue of linear heating.
- **Departmental talk 18/07/2022** ([here](./assets/data/CFSA-Seminar-180722.mp4))
	- Introductory talk in my first year of Ph.D. detailing my project aims and some early work with benchmark simulations and data analysis.
