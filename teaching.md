## Teaching


Teaching & tutoring
======
- **2023-24** : As below, including the development of using Fourier transforms to investigate spectra of tuning forks and to measure the radius and mass of stars using helioseismology. Also began developing the later helioseismology experiment to include the full dataset of the satellite to improve frequency resolution.
- **2021-23** : Lead 1st year undergraduates in their experiments regarding simple harmonic motion, Newton's law of cooling and investigating helioseismology using Fourier transforms.
- **2021** : Tutoring for MyTutor
	- Tutored GCSE and A-level students in Maths and Physics. As a result of the pandemic many students were left disadvantaged and schools as a result hired private tutors through MyTutor. Wrote a [reflective piece](./assets/data/reflective-piece-tobias.pdf) on teaching UGs at university and referenced often my experience with tutoring students throughout the pandemic.
